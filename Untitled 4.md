# recharging wsn problem

- WSN: network of sensors connected using internet
- problem: optimize wireless recharging
- WRSN: WSN that is rechargable
	- one uses batteries + drones that replaces batteries to resupply energy.
- charging models
	- 1/many mobile charger
	- single/multi-node charging
	- periodic/on-demand charging

## static
- const power (taken as avg)
### single-charger + single-node
- objectives
	- minimize dead sensors
	- maximize energy given

### single-charger + multi-node
=> +charging locations in output
### MCMN
=> +multi-agent

## dynamic
+objective: 
maximize alive time
=> RL
