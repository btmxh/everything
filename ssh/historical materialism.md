## The production of life
Social production includes:
- Material production
- Spiritual production
- Human (re)production

**Key idea**: Material production has been the foundation of society's existence and development

The other two kinds of production depend on material production.

## Productive forces and relations of production
**Mode of production** (MOP): Stuff that was **directly** involved in social material production.
- Productive forces (PF): Material part of MOP
	- Laborer: people that directly produce stuff, i.e. use [[labor]]
	- Means of production (MeOP): the other part that is not human
		- Subject of labor (SOL): basically input/materials
		- Means of labor (MeOL): basically tools
			- Tools of labor: tools that directly interact ig
			- "phương tiện" of labor: the other thing
	- Science: new shit
- Relations of production (ROP): Spiritual part of MOP
	- Relations of ownership
	- Relations of organization
	- Relations of distribution

Because materialism, the productive forces have great influence on the relations of production.

If ROP and PF are in a "our paces does not suit each other", disaster struck and it will automatically adjust back to the original state of having the same pace.
- PF decides ROP. e.g. capitalism needs "great industrial capitalism"
- ROP can affect PF. e.g. pol pot remove Cambodian industry.

## Base & Superstructure
Base = Means of production + Relations of production
Superstructure = Stuff that are not directly involved with production (culture, art, laws, families, etc.)

The superstructure maintains (and shapes) the base, while the base shapes (and maintains) the superstructure in a spiral pattern, with the base being generally more dominant here.
