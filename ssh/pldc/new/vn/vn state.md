### Principles of execution (nguyên tắc HĐ)
- People can participate in the [[state]] (direct/indirect)
- There are separate bodies for legis + exec + judi, all of this state power belongs to the people.
- **Democratic concentration principle**: State agencies like [[vn pc]] and [[vn na]] are publicly voted, and all other agencies are formed on this basis. Lower-order (cấp dưới) agencies must do tasks given by their higher-order ones, but they are "tự chủ" and can "use their creativity" while doing so.
- Led by the communist party, also based on the principle of equality and ethnically unification (đoàn kết dân tộc)
