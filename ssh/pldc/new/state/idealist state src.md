- God-ish theory ([kek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ood6swvdzc)): The state was created by god to maintain order.
- Family-based theory: The state is a natural extension of families.
- Psychology-based theory: Humans tend to want something to depend onto: the state.
- Violence theory: States form as a result of annexation wars (chiến tranh xâm lược)

=> All of these theories somewhat agree with the fact that states are **eternal**, **created by something that's not human**.
> e.g.
>- god is eternal + not human => state is eternal
>- family is eternal (at least till humans stop fucking, which is the process specified by evolution => not human) => state is eternal
>- psychology of human is eternal (and not specified by human) => state is eternal

**Social contract theory**:
The state is a contract of people to abide by certain laws and rules, signed before the formation of the state (aka the contract).

=> All of these theories are **idealist**, and does not talk about the **material conditions of society**.
