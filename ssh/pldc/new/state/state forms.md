A state form (hình thức nhà nước) contains
- Government form (hình thức chính thể)
- Structural form (hình thức cấu trúc nhà nước)
- Political system (chế độ chính trị)

## Gov. forms
### Common facts
- **Government**: bộ máy nhà nước, the system that govern (make, execute, judge laws) a state.
	- **Legislature** (lập pháp): the part of the gov that makes laws
	- **Executive** (hành pháp): the part of the gov that executes laws
	- **Judiciary** (tư pháp): the part of the gov that judges laws.
- **Vietnamese Government** (chính phủ Việt Nam) is only the executive branch of the *real government*, the **State administration of Vietnam** (Nhà nước Việt Nam).
- **Legislature** body is usually called the **parliament** (nghị viện). The *leader* of this is called "thủ tướng (nghị viện)" in Vietnamese. In English, there are many names for this, like the *Chancellor of Germany* or the *Prime Minister of the United Kingdom*. We will refer to this official as the LPM (legislature prime minister != prime minister)
	- In bicameral (lưỡng viện) parliaments, they are split into two separate assemblies: the **Lower house** (hạ nghị viện/viện thứ dân) and the **Upper house** (thượng nghị viện). Despite the name, the **Lower house** is actually somewhat more powerful than the **Upper house**.
- **Executive** body is called the **government** in some stupid nation. The *leader* of this is called **president** - "tổng thống" (in presidential systems) or sometimes **prime minister** - "thủ tướng (chính phủ)". The two "thủ tướng" is confusing.
- **Judiciary** body has many **courts**, with the most OP one being the **supreme court**. The leader of said court is the # **chief justice** - "chánh án tòa".
- **The head of state** (HOS) is the *official* leader of a state (despite may not actually being the leader), represent the state and its people.
- **The head of government** (HOG) is the *de facto* leader of the state, being the highest or second-highest official (with the highest might be the HOS) in the **executive** body.
	- In Vietnam, the HOG is not exactly the *de facto* leader (Thủ tướng Chính phủ) (because communism)

### Monarch
- In monarchs, the role of being the **head of state** is passed down through a family line, with the HOS being usually referred to as the King or the Queen.
- Depending on the amount of power this HOS has, we have two main kinds of monarchs

#### Absolute
- When the HOS has absolute power (so they also are HOG) (legislature + executive + judiciary), which is backed by bullshit like "i am the son of god", etc.
- Popular within slave/feudal states.

#### Limited/Constitutional
Otherwise, we have the following two cases:
- The HOS still has some significant power => NN-constitutional (nhị nguyên): shares legislature + executive with the parliament.
	- However, the HOS still have great power, as they have full power in selecting the "chính phủ" (executive branch), which is not responsible to the parliament. Hence, despite the constitution (hiến pháp) giving the parliament legislature rights, they can't directly affect the executive branch's work.
	- The HOS can designate the Upper house (thượng nghị viện) and dissolve the parliament.
- The HOS is effectively ceremonial => DN-constitutional (đại nghị)
	- The government is the **HOS's government** (e.g. UK has *His Majesty's Government*), but is not responsible to the HOS.
	- The HOG is called "thủ tướng" (regularly called PM), which was designated as the leader of the overwhelming party in the Lower house (hạ nghị viện/viện thứ dân) + the approval of the HOS (so basically it's still selected by the parliament)
	- The executive branch is responsible to the parliament.
### Noble Republic
Similar to democratic republic, but the people in charge are voted by nobles, and not peasants.

### Democratic Republic
- Basically no kings, but there can still be a HOS (**the president**, tổng thống/chủ tịch nước). All of the republic kinds below can have a president.
- In the first three kinds, the president is the head of the executive body.

#### Presidential
- The president is also the HOG, being popularly voted (popular vote: dân bầu/cơ quan đại diện dân bầu) in every term.
- **Features**:
	- Better separation of power => Both legislature and executive bodies are publicly voted.
	- The president is responsible to the parliament, but his people are not (considered as helpers of the president).
	- Judges are selected by the president with the approval of the Upper House, based on their abilities and morals and not their political background.
	- The executive branch is not responsible to the parliament for its political ideologies. The parliament can't shoo shoo the president, and the president can't dissolve the parliament (before the end of term).

#### Constitutional
- The president is elected by the parliament, have a well-defined term of office.
- The executive body is formed on the basis of the parliament, like what the overwhelming party is or something, being responsible to the parliament.
- If the LPM can no longer be trusted (bất tín nhiệm), the whole parliament is dissolved.

#### Mixed
A mixed combination of the two above forms
- The president is publicly voted, being the leader of the executive body while deciding state policies (basically making laws, "định hoạch chính sách quốc gia").
- The executors are the prime minister and the ministers (các bộ trưởng). This group of people is called the **cabinet**. The president can dissolve the current cabinet and form a new one.
- The president can dissolve the Lower house.

#### Socialist/Communist
Three types:
- Soviet
- Paris Commune
- People's Democratic Republic
See [[vietnam]]

## State structure
vi: hình thức cấu trúc nhà nước
### Unitary
- Common sovereign (chủ quyền)
- Common law system
- A singular government from **Central** (trung ương) to **Local** (địa phương)

### Federal
- Formed from two or more sub-states (state here can mean *nước* hoặc *bang*). Every state has its own government and law system.
- There is also a central (chung) government and law system

### Union
- A temporary union of many states, like the EU.

## Political system
- The methods that state power is executed (by the ruling classes).
- Two main types: **democratic** and **anti-democratic**, which **partially** reflects how democratic a certain state is (**but not fully, since it depends on the government form too**).
	- **Democratic**: state power is executed with the general agreement of the people, the people can participate and monitor the state's work => the people own the state.
	- **Anti-democratic**: the opposite of the above
- Can be described in stuffs like the state constitution, the government structure as well as the amount of power that a certain group of officials uphold, etc.
