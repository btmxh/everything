According to [[idealist state src]] theories, [[primitive communism]] can somewhat be considered a state. However, Marxist theories consider this system to not be a state, and therefore Marxists found a position in time when a state formed (i.e. collapse of [[primitive communism]]).

In [[primitive communism]], despite being lawless and stateless, the sprouts of a new state have already been planned.
Three major **divisions of labor**:
- Separate **husbandry** from **horticulture**
- Separate **handcraft** from **agriculture**
- **Emergence of merchants**

The last division effectively transformed [[autarky]] into [[comod prod]] economy, creating the first [[market]].

The abundance of [[comod]] gave birth to inequality. Different people have different amounts of production forces and means of production, thus having different amount of abundance (ofc there are people who still lack stuff). This makes **ownership** (tư hữu) significant.

The people who lack stuff now want stuff from the people have an abundant amount of. **Tensions between social classes** (đấu tranh giai cấp) rose => there must be some system to moderate this tension: the state.

The state is run by the social classes that is more economically advantageous, i.e. the **ruling classes**. The other classes, being ruled over, is called the **ruled classes**.

Hence, the two conditions for a [[state]] to form are:
- Ownership (tư hữu)
- Class conflict (xung đột giai cấp)
