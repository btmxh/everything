> According to [[idealist state src]]s, [[law]] comes from gods etc.
- In [[primitive communism]], people often abide by certain conventions which was based on **habits** and **religions**. When [[primitive communism]] collapses and [[state]]s formed, these conventions were turned into [[law]]s by the [[state]].
The [[state]] selects parts of these habits and religions that could be useful to control society => law consists of three sources:
- **Tập quán pháp**: taken from habits
- **Tiền lệ pháp**: taken from past resolutions of laws, i.e. using a past decision as a template for future reoccurrences.
- **Văn bản quy phạm pháp luật**: new documents specifying new laws enacted by the [[state]]
=> The [[state]] has full control over its [[law]]s, can make new laws, as well as executing and judging such laws. Without laws, the [[state]] is effectively useless.

## Law documents
- **Law norms documents** (LND, văn bản quy phạm pháp luật): are documents enacted by a (or many) **competent authority** (cơ quan có thẩm quyền)
- LND specifies a set of behavioral rules etc. etc., can be apply many times for many cases (execution does not stop its validity)
- LND includes
	- **Law documents** (LD, văn bản luật): documents enacted by the **parliament** (or National Assembly in VN's case) => highest lawful value
	- **Under law documents** (ULD, văn bản dưới luật): enacted by smaller authorities.
