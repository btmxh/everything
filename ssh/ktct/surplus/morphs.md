**cost** $K=C+V$
	- repr only initial cost: $C+V$, but not the full cost: $C+V+M$?
	- remove the difference between $C$ and $V$
	=> misconception: $K$ gives $M$ => both $C$ and $V$ gives $M$
	=> hide the exploitative nature of [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital]]ism: both the capitalist and laborer create [[surplus]]
**profit**: "hình thái chuyển hóa" of $M$
	- demand > supply => [[price]] > [[value]] => $P > M$
	- other inequalities...
	=> we have $M>0$ in all cases, but $P$ may be less than $0$
	- misconceptive nature: $P$ comes from $K$, not from $V$ and $M$
	=> hide the difference in class of [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital]]ism
**profit rate**: $P'=\frac{P}{K}=\frac{M}{C+V}$: how efficient the business is

## Inter-branch capitalism
**average profit rate**: 
- different branches have different profits, profit rates => [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital]] will flow in order to make things more equal
- => all profit/profit rate converge to the avg profit/profit rate
- **Definition**: the common **profit rate** for all **branches** in society, being formed by the competitiveness among all branches.
- => $\bar{P'}=\frac{\sum P_{i}}{\sum K_{i}}$ (the total profit divides the total cost)
**average profit**: the common profit of all branches in society given the same cost, being formed bla bla bla
=> $\bar{P}=P'\times K$

**Conditions for [[competitive]]ness among branches**:
- Technology: có "Đại công nghiệp tư bản chủ nghĩa" (great capitalist industry?)
- Market: [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital]] can **freely** be transferred from a branch to another.
- => Competitiveness is a feature of **Freely-competitive capitalism**

## Dividing [[surplus]] among branches
### Merchant [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital]]ist
Merchant [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital]]ist shares the same birth with capitalism, because it was the result of:
- Development in DOL & specialization
- Opposite: producers >< consumers

**Definition**: Merchant capitalist is the kind of [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital]]ist gắn kết with producers, representing the **producers** in [[comod]] consumption, **have a share of the profits** along with the producers.
Before capitalism, they were separated with the producers, being the **customers** of the producers, and followed principles such as "mua rẻ, bán đắt", "mua đứt, bán đoạn" => they had a low reputation.

### Rental capitalist
- Tư bản tiền tệ tạm thời nhàn rỗi
- Được quyền sở hữu nhường quyền sử dụng cho người khác
- Mục đích của người sở hữu là có lợi tức.
- **Lợi tức:** một phần GTTD công nhân SX ra, đc nhà tư bản đi vay trích lại cho nhà tư bản cho vay, để đổi lấy quyền sử dụng tiền.
