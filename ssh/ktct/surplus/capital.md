## circulation
- consider these two circulations of [[ssh/ktct/new/commodity/money]] into [[goods]] and vice versa
	- $H - T -H'$ -> formula based on [[use value]], used for laborers
	- $T-H-T'$, with $T'>T$  in most case (economic growth) -> formula based on [[value]] => [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital]]'s formula
- the [[surplus]] is $\Delta T=T'-T$
	- $H'$ can't be infinite, because humans can't consume that much [[goods]] (see my cultural capitalism)
	- $T'$ can be infinite (for all practical purposes), so the growth of [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital]] can be infinite (as long as $T'>T$) => **the $T-H-T'$ formula is not bounded**, and because of this key property, it can model a manifacturing system: **capitalism**
	- e.g. human greed is always attached to money
		- people buy apartments after apartments, real estates after real estates -> the consumption seems infinite: FALSE, there is no consumption here, they're doing business, those real estates are [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital]] used to generate [[surplus]]

## def
**capital** is [[value]] used to generate [[surplus]]
