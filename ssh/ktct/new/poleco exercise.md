New value of a product/created by a laborer: $v+m$
Mass of new value (in all products/created by all laborers): $V+M$
Value of an unit of product: $c+v+m$
Net value of products: $C+V+M$
[[cost]] of production: $C+V$
Daily [[labor]] time: $t+t'$
[[surplus]] rate: $m'=\frac{t'}{t}=\frac{m}{v}$ (percentage)
Mass of [[surplus]]: $M=m'V$ => $m'=\frac{M}{V}$
[[profit]] rate: $P'=\frac{P \approx M}{K=C+V}$
Organic composition of capital: $\frac{C}{V}$

with:
$C$: Net cost of the means of production
$V$: Net cost of [[labor]] wage
$M$: Mass of [[surplus]]
$P'$: [[profit]] rate
$c, v, m$: cost for the means of production, cost for [[labor]] wage and [[surplus]], over an unit of products
$m'$: [[surplus]] rate
$t$: necessarily [[labor]] time
$t'$: [[surplus]] [[labor]] time

notes:
$K=C+V$: total cost of production != $C$: total cost of the means of production
$V+M$: mass of new value != $M$: mass of [[surplus]]

## Absolute production
e.g.
- Initially, new value is 250kUSD/day, [[surplus]] rate $150\%$
- Then, capitalist increase labor time from 7.5h/day to 9h/day with no wage increase
=> surplus rate & mass change?
=> explain the changes
$V_{1}+M_{1}=250kUSD$, $m_{1}'=\frac{M_{1}}{V_{1}}=1.5$ => $M_{1}=150kUSD, V_{1}=100kUSD$
$t_{1}+t_{1}'=7.5h, m'=\frac{t_{1}'}{t_{1}}=1.5$ => $t_{1}'=4.5h,t_{1}=3h$
we have $V_{1}=V_{2}$ => $t_{1}=t_{2}, t_{2}+t_{2}'=9h$ => $t_{2}=3h,t_{2}'=6h$ => $m_{2}'=200\%$, $M_{2}=m_{2}'V_{2}=200kUSD$
=>
- initially, surplus mass $150kUSD$, surplus rate $150\%$
- then, surplus mass $200kUSD$, surplus rate $200\%$
- => both number increases, explain: capitalist applied "phương pháp sử dụng phương pháp sản xuất GTTD tuyệt đối", via extending the [[labor]] time from 7.5h/day to 9h/day without any extra wage for the [[labor]]ers

e.g. cost of prod $4MUSD$, org. comp. of capital $\frac{9}{1}$, $m'_{1}=188\%$
then capitalist drop $10\%$ of its laborers => [[labor]] time, productivity, output scale const
- find $m'_{2}, M_{1}, M_{2}, P'_{1}, P'_{2}$
- explain

we have $C_{1}+V_{1}=4MUSD, \frac{C_{1}}{V_{1}}=\frac{9}{1}$ => $C_{1}=3.6MUSD, V_{1}=0.4MUSD$
=> $M_{1}=m_{1}'V_{1}=752kUSD,P_{1}'=\frac{M_{1}}{C_{1}+V_{1}}=18.8\%$
- [[labor]] time const + output const, drop $10\%$ laborers => $V_{2}=0.9V_{1}=360kUSD$
- productivity const => value of product const
- output const => num of products const => net value of product const => $C_{1}+V_{1}+M_{1}=C_{2}+V_{2}+M_{2}$
- output const => $C_{1}=C_{2}$
=> $M_{2}=792kUSD\dots$
- explain: the change is due to the capitalist applying "phương pháp SXGTTD tương đối", by apply technological advancements in increasing social productivity, therefore decreasing value of [[labor]] in every product

## capital accum & unemployment
e.g.
- initially, $m'=400\%$, 100 [[labor]]ers, new value for each laborer $1600USD$
- then $94.5\%$ of [[surplus]] is used in capital accumulation => $\frac{C}{V}$ from $\frac{15}{1}$ to $\frac{41}{2}$, profit rate const
=>
- find change of $m'$, $M$, num of unemployed laborers (assuming the wage of each laborer stays the same)
- explain

- $\frac{M_{1}}{V_{1}}=4$, $M_{1}+V_{1}=100\times1600USD=160kUSD$ => $M_{1}=128kUSD, V_{1}=32kUSD$, since $\frac{C_{1}}{V_{1}}=\frac{15}{1}$, $C_{1}=480kUSD$ => profit rate $P_{1}'=\frac{M_{1}}{C_{1}+V_{1}}=25\%$
- $\Delta K=0.945M_{1}=120.96kUSD$ => $C_{2}+V_{2}=C_{1}+V_{1}+\Delta K=632.96kUSD$
- $\frac{C_{2}}{V_{2}}=\frac{41}{2}, P_{1}'=P_{2}'$ => $C_{2}=603.52kUSD,V_{2}=29.44kUSD,M_{2}=158.24kUSD$
- num of unemployed laborers: $100\left( 1-\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}} \right)=8$ ripbozo
- $m_{1}'=400\%, m_{2}'=537.5\%, M_{1}=128kUSD$,$M_{2}=158.24kUSD$
- **explanation**: the capitalist applied "phương pháp tích lũy tư bản" changing the OCC from 15/1 to 41/2 + insert definition of the method here
