## Forms of value
The need of [[trade]] forced people to invent a system to systemize their tradings.
### Simple (randomized) form of value
vi: hình thái giản đơn (ngẫu nhiên) của giá trị
**Def:** A way of measuring [[value]] of a [[comod]] via trading with another [[comod]]
e.g. 1 xe máy = 10 tấn thóc => one used *thóc* to measure the [[value]] of the motorbike => thóc là **vật ngang giá** (VNG)

**Features**
- based on direct trade: $H \to H'$
- inconsistent and randomized because people can't fathom the real [[value]] of a [[comod]]

### Total (expanded) form of value
vi: hình thái toàn bộ (mở rộng) của giá trị

**Def:** A way of measuring [[value]] of a [[comod]] via **regularly trading** with **many other** [[comod]]
e.g. 1 cái rìu = 20 kg thóc, 5 con gà, 3m vải, 0.1 chỉ vàng => one measured the value of *rìu* using many VNGs

**Features**
- Still direct: $H \to H'$
- Too many VNGs => complex system

### Common form of value
vi: hình thái chung của giá trị
**Def:** A way of measuring [[value]] of a [[comod]] via a **common, generally-accepted** VNG (within a local scope)

e.g. a xe máy b ô tô c thằng tranny duy bựa = 1 chỉ vàng: common VNG

**Features**
- Based on systematic trade including VNG: $H \to VNG \to H'$
- Each local communities have their own common VNG

### Currency form
**Def:** A way of measuring [[value]] of a [[comod]] via a **common, socially-accepted** VNG as the sole VNG for all [[comod]]s

e.g. same as above

=> **Currency**:
- a special form of [[comod]]
- is chosen by society to be the **sole** VNG for all [[comod]]s
- used to measure the value of all [[comod]]s

=> The only [[comod]] suitable to be [[currency]] in human history is **gold and silver** (because high [[use value]] + high [[value]])

## Usage
- Measure value (đo lường giá trị): the OG usage of [[currency]]
	- the **price** of a [[comod]] is its [[value]] represented in [[currency]]
- Storage (cất trữ)
	- remove [[currency]] from circulation to preserve the [[value]] of [[currency]]
	- three levels: State, Business, Household
- Circulation (lưu thông)
	- because society uses [[currency]] to [[trade]] => [[currency]] is circulated throughout society ($H \to \text{Currency} \to H'$)
- Payment (thanh toán)
	- one can use [[currency]] to make payments instead of directly using [[comod]] => many features like *thanh toán trả chậm, mua bán chịu*
- World currency (tiền tệ thế giới)
	- one can use [[currency]] to make payments all around the world
	- until 19th century, one can only use gold + silver to do this, but the *exchange rate regime* (Chế độ tỷ giá hối đoái) solved this issue => globalization

### Paper money
vi: tiền chứng chỉ

It's very hard for actual currency to circulate, so governments have to come up with another form of money that could circulate more easily: paper money. Paper money are convenient, but they lost most of the value that their corresponding currency had.

> Initially, govs used gold-based money, which led to many problems (govs printing too much money are unable to pay back gold). To solve this problem, nowadays money are not attached to gold (at least after the Bretton Wood system). This poses many threats to modern economies, since a government collapsing will mean that the paper money distributed by that government is now basically worthless.

Paper money, because of the government's ability to print out more money, are prone to inflation. Therefore, storing large amount of paper money is not a good idea.
