With free [[competitive]]ness, the [[profit]] rate of every [[sectors]] would be the same.
Reality is not like this => there is no longer free [[competitive]]ness. Lenin stated that we has gone too far into **Monopoly Capitalism** (MC).
> lmfao nayuta

**Definition**: **Monopoly** is the concentration of a great amount of some kind of [[comod]] production/consumption within a league of large businesses.

=> Can decide the input/output prices for profits:
- High price when sell to customers
- Low price when buy from providers
=> Monopoly profit: a [[superprofit]] higher than average profit $\bar{P}$ via the "chiếm đoạt" of
- Laborers
- Customers
- Providers

## Formation of MC
- Free [[competitive]] => [[gather law]].
- Developments of productive forces in the Industrial Revolution => Capitalists need to concentrate their resource (tập trung nguồn lực) to follow the recent developments (otherwise ded xd).
- Economy crises on late XIX - early XX => need capital concentration to survive through the crises.

> For cultural capitalism:
> // - Recommendation algorithms? => can this become a [[market]] law?
> - Copyrights aka the means of production?
> - Cultural revolutions?
> - Cultural crises?
> - COVID-19?
> - **Law of cultural exploration**

## Effects
### Good
=> Resource concentration
- "Thúc đẩy" great production.
- Great investment in science and technology
- Increase the power of the [[market]]?
### Bad
- Destroy competition
- Further division of society
- Limit external creativity

=> **Monopoly is born from competition, is the opposite of competition, but does not destroys competition, only making competition more complicated**.
Types of competition post-monopoly:
- Internal (wrt the monopoly org), Between orgs, monopoly vs non-monopoly, non-monopoly vs non-monopoly
=> all of these happen on all fronts: economy, politics, military, etc.
