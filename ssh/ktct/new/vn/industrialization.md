## Industrial Revolution

Content-wise: development "về chất" of TLLD
Foundation-wise: on the basis of systematic technological groundbreaking discoveries
- chinese discovering gunpowder is not a "revolution", since it's not "systematic" (not in a series of industrial revolutions)
- people make faster computer (utilizing the same tech) is not a revolution, since it's "groundbreaking", just an extension of old tech or sth
Purpose-wise?:
- Make change "về chất" in social division of labor => improve productivity
- Change labor, management, and routine procedures of humans.

### Industrial revolutions
- 1.0
	- TNS: UK, 18th century
	- Groundbreaking discovery: Steam engine
	- => starts industrialization, form capitalism, but management is still manual
- 2.0
	- TNS: 
- 4.0
	- TNS: Various places, 21st century

**Modern Industrial Revolutions**: 3rd and 4th
**Features**
- Science became a direct productive force
	- Science has being used extensively, have direct role in comod production
	- Economic sectors that benefited from science and MIRs have taking more and more proportion of the national economy (kinh tế quốc dân)
		- Before: Inventions + Materialistic Conditions (ingredients, means of production, etc.) => Products
		- After: Inventions => Products (intellectual property)
- Time spent on upgrading inventions were more and more shortened
	- Without keeping up, the distance would be further and further. => One needs to try and keep up with science and technology inventions.
	- Give smaller nations opportunities to keep up with big ones.

### Purposes
- Foundation of economic-social development
	- Create CSKT for new societies
	- e.g.
		- Without IRs => feudal, slave: agriculture, handcraft
		- IR1.0 => primitive capitalism: industries, mechanics, engineering, etc.
		- IR2+3 => monopolistic capitalism: automation, digital, wireless connection, fossil energy, electricity, etc.
		- IR4 => socialism?: *buzzwords*
- Motivates the development of productive forces, QHSX, production management (quản trị SX), which are all social-economic features (hình thái) => improve quality of life. Then, the limits of the ruling class may have to change or be restricted to make sure that these won't harm the development process of society.

## Industrialization & Modernization
**Industrialization**
- UNIDO
	- A more-and-more-fund invocation from the economy to create a multi-sector economy with utilizing many modern scientific technologies, in order to produce TLSX + consumables comods, in order to develop and grow the economy and society
- VN
	- A basic and fundamental shift within all aspects.
	- Đầu tư, SXKD, dịch vụ và QLKT-XH
	- Từ SD lao động thủ công với phương tiện thô sơ là chính sang sử dụng phổ biến lao động với CN, phương tiện và phương pháp hiện đại dựa trên thành tựu IRs
	- Aim to generate high productivity, make technological CSVC of socialism, stable development and growth.
- **Features**
	- Thể chế, mục tiêu: Socialist-orientated
	- Kỹ thuật công nghệ: In the midst of the 3+4 (M)IRs
	- Thị trường: In the midst of globalization, hội nhập KTQT
- Tất yếu KQ
	- Do CSLL: để ptr LLSX cần tiến bộ về chất của TLLĐ
	- Do thực tiễn VN: mục tiêu xd CNXH trình độ rất cao mà nền tảng thấp 
	- Do bối cảnh thời đại: CMCN cần các QG thích ứng với CNH
