(socialist-orientated market-based economy, kttt định hướng xhcn)

- MBE is an unavoidable result of [[comod prod]] economy.
- Capitalist MBE (CMBE) have countless problems and disadvantages.
- => we need a MBE different to CMBE: **Socialist-orientated MBE**

## Definition & Features
- MBE:
	- developed [[comod prod]] economy
	- every economic relationship works in some [[market]]
	- satisfies objective [[market]] laws
- SOMBE:
	- complete MBE
	- have the management of the state and **the communist party**, with the aim being "dan giau nuoc manh dan chu cong bang van minh..."
	- => different from CMBE (no it's not lmfao)
- **Features**
	- **Objective**:
		- build **socialist** *csvc* != CMBE has none of this preparing mindset, no long-term goals
		- the people's benefit on top != CMBE cares most about businesses, not the people
		- head toward "dan giau nuoc manh..." society (no differences tbh)
	- **Ownership**
		- variants of ownership economies
			- publicly-owned: state economy, collective economy 
			- privately-owned: private economy, FI (foreign invested) economy
			- mixed: "state capital" economy => mixed the two types and share good features with the two (dynamic of private + moral of public), but hard to moderate
		- economy with many variants of ownership (kinh tế nhiều thành phần)
			- main, directive (chủ đạo): state econ.: controls important sectors (lĩnh vực then chốt), which "determine the future" etc. etc.
			- important motivation: collective, private econ.
		- => != CMBE:
			- main, directive role belongs to private economy:
			- e.g. companies make weapons and the government want to make that sell => waging war, unrest, etc., FED not controlled by the US gov., etc.
			- e.g. SOMBE: people only have "rights to use land" != land, because national soverignity is important bla bla, "kho bac nha nuoc", VTV, etc.
	- **Management**
		- Combination of objective [[market]] laws + moderation of the [[state]], to moderate economy + social affairs.
		- != CMBE: the state repr the capitalists, with lobby etc.
	- **Distribution**
		- Distribution on the basis of
			- **labor** (lao động) (SMBE)
			- **funds and capital** (vốn, tư bản) (CMBE)
			- **welfare** (phúc lợi) (communist)
		- (of course partially on the basis of the other two too)
		- (distributing not only [[comod]], but also jobs and opportunities)
		- e.g. 30% jobs in vn are state stuff
	- **Superstructure**
		- [[state]] led by CPV

## Foundations of SOMBE
### Political foundation
**QHSX fits LLSX**
- Vietnamese production is a small-scale production => needs **MBE** with many variants of ownership and
- CMBE have many problems => we need a stable foundation for development, i.e. **SO**
=> **SOMBE**

### Econ.-Social foundation
- VN needs to expand its market => needs to *hoi nhap* with the world's market => VN needs **MBE**
- To limit the problems of CMBE => VN needs **SO**
=> **SOMBE**

### Historical foundation
**Vietnamese history**
- The CPV led the "national democratic revolution"
- != world: "democratic revolutions" by capitalists

## Completion and Refinement of SOMBE Institution

**Institution**: the system of
- law and rules (luật pháp và quy tắc)
- management system (bộ máy quản lý)
- execution co che (cơ chế vận hành)
- => moderates human relationships + actions in a certain society

**Economic Institution**
- institution moderates economy?

**SOMBEI**
- ... to moderates subjects of the [[market]] in a way **that suit the current E-S development path directed by the CPV**, with the final objective being "make the csvckt for socialism and dan giau nuoc manh etc. etc."

**Components of SOMBEI**
- **Path and Law?**
	- Development plan of the CPV
	- Laws, policies, rules, etc.
- **Subjects of the Market**
	- State administration
	- Businesses and their representatives
	- People and their representatives
- **Execution laws**
	- [[market]] laws
	- execution laws of market subjects (co che phan cap, phoi hop, giam sat danh gia, tham gia, etc.)

- **Reason to continue SOMBE**
	- tht
		- The aim, objective of Vietnamese socialism is too high compared to the current state of Vietnamese production

- **Mission of SOMBE**
	- Refine "thể chế về quyền sở hữu"
	- Refine "thể chế + phát triển tpkt"
	- Refine "thể chế + đồng bộ các thị trường"
