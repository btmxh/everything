As one can see from [[currency]], one of the mean purposes of [[currency]]/[[currency#Paper money|paper money]] is to be able to **circulate** and used as a means of **payment**.

If there are too much money, the money will lose its value. Similarly, without enough money, it can not fulfill its supposed mission.

To determine the amount of [[currency]] needed to circulate on the [[market]], one uses the following formula
- $M=\frac{P\cdot Q}{V}$, with
	- $M$: the necessary amount of [[currency]]
	- $P$: the level of [[price]] (mức giá cả)
	- $Q$: the amount of service [[comod]] in circulation
	- $V$: number of circulation **rounds** of an unit of money
	- => $M \propto \Omega$: the total price of [[comod]] on the [[market]] and $M \propto \frac{1}{V}$
- When [[currency#Paper money|paper money]] is circulated instead of [[currency]], the formula becomes $M=\frac{PQ-(G_{1}+G_{2})+G_{3}}{V}$
	- $G_{1}$: tổng giá cả hàng hóa bán chịu
	- $G_{2}$: tổng giá cả hàng hóa khấu trừ cho nhau
	- $G_{3}$: tổng giá cả hàng hóa đến kỳ thanh toán
- Because one can't directly measure $P,Q,G_{1},G_{2},G_{3},V$, $M$ can't be directly calculated but rather moderated in a complex process by the government
