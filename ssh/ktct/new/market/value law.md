Both **production** and **[[ssh/ktct/new/market/circulation|circulation]]** are based on the *social* [[ssh/ktct/surplus/labor]] used in [[comod]] production.

**SNL**: social necessary labor => [[price]]
**SpNL**: specific necessary labor => [[value]]

Making $SpNL < SNL$ allows the producer to put a higher price to a low valued [[comod]] => increase profits.
However, decreasing $SpNL$ will decrease $SNL$ => in circulation, the [[price]] "vận động xoay quanh" the [[value]].

=> [[price]] is determined by [[value]], but according to the [[s-d]], [[price]] is determined by the supply and demand lines. However, the [[value law]] is more *correct* because it works in the long term.
- WLOG assuming supply < demand, then price > value => investors flocks to this industry => supply increases => price increases.
- => The two lines are not constant, and they are only accurate for a limited amount of time, meanwhile the fact that [[price]] "vận động vòng quanh" the [[value]] is **universal**.

## Implications
- Investments tend towards sectors with [[comod]] scarcity.
- Circulation of [[comod]]s tend to go from place with low price -> high price.
- Divide (phân hóa) producers. Producers with high efficiency become the "giới chủ", while less efficient producers become "giới bị chèn ép".
- Encourage producers increasing their productivity.
