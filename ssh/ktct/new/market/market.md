- **market economy** is the next step of a [[comod prod]]-based economy, with a large amt of [[trade]] happening in a common environment: **markets**
- **markets** have their own laws, which is objective (despite being a result of human activities, humans can't directly modify these laws). These laws will be abbreviated as **OMLs** (objective market laws)

## Definition
- Narrow definition: A market is a place where trading (selling + buying) happens => the connection of the **seller** and the **buyer**.
- Wide definition: A market is the composition (tổng hòa) of all relationships related to the process of selling and buying in a certain historic, economic, political conditions.
> CC definition: The market is a composition of "systems, institutions, procedures, relations and infrastructures" related to the discovery and consumption of culture.

## Classification
- Based on what was traded: "comod" market (narrow def of comod), service market. Each can be further classified into many more markets.
- Based on the type of relationships: domestic, international market
- Based on the **role** of what was traded: tư liệu tiêu dùng, tư liệu sản xuất
- Based on the characteristics of the market: Free market, regulated market, perfect competitive market, imperfect CM (monopolies)

## Role
**Specific roles**:
- Confirm (xác nhận?) the roles of [[use value]] and [[value]] in [[comod]].
	- If something doesn't sell, one can not determine the [[value]] (ofc lmao there is no price) + use value (no one uses the thing bruh)
- Conduct (thực hiện?) the [[value]] in [[comod]]: convert SNL of producer into [[currency]] through buying/selling [[comod]] on the market.
- Provide information to both producers and consumers.
	- Producers can analyze what the consumers want through their economic activities.
	- Consumers can select products in a sea of [[comod]]
- Filter (sàng lọc) producers, investing trends (xu thế đầu tư), product lines (dòng sản phẩm), etc. via the OMLs: supply-demand, competitiveness, etc.

**General** (tổng thể):
- The market provides the **environment** and the **conditions** for developments in production (specific) and the economy (general)
- Objective basis to evaluate and filter **economic subjects** (chủ thể kinh tế) and **[[comod]] products** => encourage innovation, creative minds.
- Connect and moderate economic relationships in an interactive and systematic way.

## Subjects of the market
- Producer
- Consumer
- Third parties
- The state

**The state** is responsible for ensuring the macro-environment (môi trường vĩ mô: laws, policies, security) => not directly involved in [[comod]] production.

The four subjects form a **tetrahedron**. If one subject get too close to another subject, the tetrahedron collapses and so does the economic environment, e.g. command economies.

## Market mechanism
- A system that auto-moderate economic relations and balances via OMLs.
- Market mechanism will moderate
	- Prices
	- Division of labor and work forces.
	- Product output and distribution.
- => **Self-moderate market mechanism** (SMMM): let the market does its thing, moderating via *an invisible hand*. This mechanism was first coined by Adam Smith, an advocate for SMMM.

## Market economy
**Definition**: An advanced form of [[comod prod]] economy, with every **production** and **trade relationship** being carried out through the **market**, subjected to the moderation of the OLMs.

**Features**
- Multi-sector economy structure + many types of ownership (state, private, mixed)
- Many different kinds of [[market]]s, and the division of labor across these [[market]]s are moderated via the **market laws**.
- Price is determined via the [[market]] (through its OLMs, especially [[value law]], [[s-d]])
- The most important motivation of economic development is competition.
- The state is a subject in the market economy, with its role being ensuring the stability of the macro-environment...
- Open economy, based on integration (hội nhập).

**Disadvantages of a SMMM-based market economy**:
- Lack of public goods and services.
- Risk of economic depressions and anti-competitive measures.
- Market economies are unable to fix the scarcity of resources in the economy => tends to exploit and destroy the environment (both **natural** environment and **social** environment).
- Unable to address the issues of social division (as a result of competitiveness and elimination)
- Tendency to become monopolized.
=> A pure SMMM-based economy is effectively unfeasible.
=> The additional moderation of the **state** is needed: **a visible hand**. Hence, a market economy needs the combination of the two hands in economic moderation.
