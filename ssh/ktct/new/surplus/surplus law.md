This law states that as time passes, productions will become more and more exploitative (production scale increases, capitalist steal more [[surplus]])
=> 4 major problems of capitalism:
- purpose: steal [[surplus]]
- method: exploit wagies
- opposites: laborers vs capitalists
- future, direction: will be removed by some socialist revolution brought upon by the laborers

**new developments**:
- scale: cooperations expands beyond the borders of countries
- tính chất: class conflict -> nation conflict: "global north" exploit the "global south" for its own benefits
	- colonialism: turn smaller nations into colonies (old kind of colonialism) -> *manipulate* the smaller nation into doing good stuff for the parent nation (new kind of colonialism)
	- economic barrier:
		- stuff from small -> big: easy
		- stuff from big -> small: hard
		- e.g. vietnam export issue
- barriers:
	- barrier of engineering
		- big nation establish many strict standards => smoll nations can't adapt to them. => ded
	- barrier of social standards
		- big nation causes pollutions, uses child labor => harming smoll nations in the standard
		- e.g. paper bags, etc.
	- barrier of no-dumping (phá giá):
		- basically dumping: sell shit for low price, which may in a way, make the shit popular => ban dumping may make some producers less powerful or sth idk
		- very good because many western countries consider vn to be a non-market economy
