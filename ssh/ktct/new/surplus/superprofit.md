giá trị thặng dư siêu ngạch
- used to repr "[[surplus]]" between *bourgeoises*
e.g.
- shop A sell rst album with price 100jpy => surplus 50jpybut
- shop B sell the same thing with price 75jpy => surplus 50jpy
- if shop B sell with price 100jpy, the total surplus is 75jpy = old surplus (50jpy) + [[superprofit]] (25jpy)

[[superprofit]] only makes sense for a specific bourgeois, there's no such thing as society-level [[superprofit]], being the motivation for innovations in science and technology.

**def**: the increase in [[surplus]] of a **specific** bourgeois s.t. specific productivity > common productivity => specific value < market value, but one still sell the products at market value (superprofit is market value - specific value)

[[superprofit]] makes capitalists compete with each other, being the motivation for many important developments in production technologies.
