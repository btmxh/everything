**Definition:** Capital is [[value]] used to generate [[surplus]].
Question: How is [[ssh/ktct/surplus/capital|capital]] able to generate [[surplus]] from thin air?

## Circulation formulas
Consumers' formula: $H-T-H'$ => limited by the consumption of $H'$.
Capitalists' formula: $T-H-T'$, with $T'>T$ => can repeat indefinitely.
The surplus is $\Delta T=T'-T$, we may ask where this comes from.

**Hypothesis**: [[surplus]] comes from [[ssh/ktct/new/market/circulation|circulation]]
3 cases:
- [[price]] <= [[value]] => $T'\leq T, \Delta T\leq0$ => no [[surplus]]
- [[price]] > [[value]] => $T'>T$, but the $\Delta T$ is compensated by other people's money => society as a whole can't have $T'>T$ => no surplus

**Hypothesis**: [[surplus]] does not need [[ssh/ktct/new/market/circulation|circulation]]
Without [[ssh/ktct/new/market/circulation|circulation]], inputs and outputs can't be connected in a production pipeline, and therefore there can't be any $\Delta T$.

From the falsifications of the two hypotheses, we can deduce that:
- ***Tư bản không thể xuất hiện từ lưu động và cũng không thể xuất hiện từ bên ngoài lưu thông. Nó phải xuất hiện trong lưu thông và đồng thời không phải trong lưu thông"***
- Or, more concisely, [[surplus]] can only be generated with the aids of [[ssh/ktct/new/market/circulation|circulation]], but pure [[ssh/ktct/new/market/circulation|circulation]] is not enough to generate [[surplus]].
- This is called the *mâu thuẫn công thức chung của tư bản*.

So, since [[ssh/ktct/new/market/circulation|circulation]] only provides the environment for [[surplus]] to be generated, one may consider the inputs of the production pipeline.
And it turns out that [[surplus]] is generated by [[ssh/ktct/new/surplus/labor|labor]].

This can be modeled as a fuller picture.
- $T \to H=C+V$
- $C \to C$, with $C$ being the **constant [[ssh/ktct/new/surplus/capital|capital]]**, which does not change during the process.
- $V\to V+M$, with $V$ being the **variable [[ssh/ktct/new/surplus/capital|capital]]**, value that is used in **regenerate value in [[labor]]**.
- $C+V+M \to H' \to T'$

Since $C+V+M>C+V$, $T'>T$, and we have $\Delta T=M$ is the [[surplus]].
