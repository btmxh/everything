As one can see from [[ssh/ktct/new/surplus/capital|capital]] and [[labor]], $\Delta T=M$ is the [[surplus]].
- [[surplus]] comes from the special properties of [[labor]]: the ability to regenerate labor and generate more value than the regeneration cost, but they were stolen by the capitalist.
- [[surplus]] becomes a social relationship, representing how exploitative the capitalist is to their laborers.
- Since [[labor]] is used to generate both $V$ and $M$, the labor time can be split into two parts: $t$ - necessary labor time and $t'$ - surplus labor time.

## Surplus rate
$m'=\frac{m}{v}=\frac{t'}{t}$
=> represent how exploitative the capitalist is.

## Total surplus
vi: khối lượng gttd
$M=m'V$ => $m'=\frac{M}{V}$
=> represent the scale of capitalist exploitation.

## Production
Capitalists want to increase $m'$ to inc $M$, then there are two ways for them.
### Absolute surplus production (increases $t'$)
vi: phương pháp sản xuất GTTD **tuyệt đối**
- Capitalist increases the work time $t+t'$ while keeping the same pay. Since $v\propto t$, $t$ const and $t'$ increases. And because $m\propto t'$, we have more surplus now.
- This is used in old-style capitalism (imperialism, etc.)
=> this made laborers angery, and one could not physically exploit laborers by increase $t'$ forever (as $t+t'$ has physical bounds)

#### Relative surplus production (decreases $t$)
name: phương pháp sản xuất GTTD **tương đối**
- Applying innovations in Science and Technology => increase productivity => decrease [[comod]] value => decrease $v$ and therefore $t$
- Since $t+t'$ const => $t$ dec while $t'$ inc => $m'$ inc.
=> this satisfies both sides while relying on the infinite growth of technology + we live in the 4th revo, this has been extensively used in modern capitalism.
