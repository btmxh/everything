- In [[comod prod]], labor is a special [[comod]], being the "combination of physical strength + mental power (thể lực + trí lực) of humans that can be used in manifacturing [[goods]]"

> In cultural capitalism, (cultural) labor is the act of consuming culture, being the combination of "physical strength + mental power + most importantly, **time**" that can be used in consuming culture.

## twofold
- According to Marx, labor is a combination of **abstract labor** and **concrete labor**.
- **Concrete labor** is labor in a specific professions
> example: trannydb programming, kano 2023 shilling her capitalistic and schizo albums, gigachad seiyuu breathing are different kinds of "work"s, and they are not exchangable. For example, one can't let the trannydb shill kano 2023's albums (no one will buy it then xd) or kano 2023 breathing like le gigachad seiyuu (she can but that does not create commodities because le gigachad seiyuu is too gigachad) bla bla bla
- Stripping away the differences in concrete labor, like the tools, the motivation, the materials needed to do work, etc. etc., we arrive at the definition of **abstract labor**: labor but excluding its specificity, like exhausting, mental toll, etc. idk the words
=> **Abstract labor** gives birth to the [[comod]]'s [[value]], while **concrete labor** is responsible for its [[use value]].
=> **Concrete labor** represents the "individuality" of [[comod prod]], while **abstract labor** represents the "sociality" part.

> In cultural capitalism, we may ask what is the representation of the aforementioned concepts
> Similarly to labor, the act of consuming culture is not simple, different kinds of cultures required different tools to consume, like you need a PC/smartphone to consume cyberculture, headphone/speaker to consume music culture, etc., so that's where the concept of **concrete labor** emerges. But, stripping away all of these "specificities", we also get our definition of **abstract labor**.

## conds
For labor to be considered as a special [[comod]], by definition of [[comod]], it needs to be sold on the market. Hence, we need to conditions:
- 1. The laborer is free
- 2. The laborer has no means of production

- without cond 1, the laborer are selling themselves, not just their labor.
- without cond 2, the laborer won't sell their labor, but use them directly instead to gain wealth (without a capitalist stripping away their [[surplus]]).
- => laborer is forced to sell their labor to capitalist
- history:
	- [[primitive communism]]: no surplus => no one sells labor
	- monarchy: restrict laborers
	- slave: sell slaves (including their labor + lives + ...), not slaves' labor
	- **capitalism**
		- *economy*: divided because of industrial revolutions + bourgeoisie yoinked all means of production
		- *politics*: monarchy is ded, the freedom is no longer restricted + democratic -> the people actually *somewhat* controls the [[state]]
		- => best conditions for laborers to sell their labor

## as a [[comod]]
Since [[ssh/ktct/new/surplus/labor|labor]] is pure [[ssh/ktct/new/surplus/labor|labor]], one may consider [[ssh/ktct/new/surplus/labor|labor]] to be a special [[comod]].
An important feature of [[labor]] is that [[labor]] can be **regenerated**. This takes [[value]], called the **value of labor comod**, includes
- Material needs
- Spiritual needs
- Family needs
[[labor]] has an important [[use value]]: to generate [[value]]. This newly generated [[value]] can be higher than the aforementioned **value of labor comod**, which means that [[labor]] can generate [[value]] out of thin air. This is the source of [[surplus]].
The reason why [[labor]] has such an "OP" feature is due to the abilities of the laborers, like the ability to do stuff, be creative with stuff, etc.

- labor's value: the [[cost of labor]] needed to restore laborer's labor
	- e.g. one needs food, drink, excess, day off, etc. to refill their energy
	- **three parts**
		- material needs
		- spiritual needs
		- family needs
- **usage:**
