## Intersector competition
vi: Cạnh tranh giữa các ngành
**Definition:** The flow of [[ssh/ktct/new/surplus/capital|capital]] from one economic sector to another in order to find a sector with high $P'$.
This flow makes profitable sectors less profitable and unprofitable ones more profitable => balancing the profit rate of sectors.
Hence, [[ssh/ktct/new/surplus/capital|capital]] will oscillate around the balance point (like in [[harmonic motion]]), with all sectors in the balance point having the same profit rate. This common profit rate is called the **average profit rate** (tỷ suất lợi nhuận bình quân), denoted as $\bar{P'}$
$\bar{P'}$ can be calculated as follows:
$\bar{P'}=\frac{\sum P_{k}}{\sum K_{k}}$, with $P_{k}$ and $K_{k}$ being the [[profit]] and [[cost]] in sector index $k$
To get the **average profit**, one multiply $\bar{P'}$ with the **average cost** $\bar{K}$:$\bar{P}=\bar{P'} \cdot \bar{K}$

## Conditions of Intersector competition
- Technology: needs *great capitalist industry* (đại công nghiệp TBCN)
- Market: Capital must be able to freely flow between sectors.
=> Needs **Free-competitive market economy**.
