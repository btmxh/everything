In our current market economy, [[surplus]] is split and given to 4 classes of people:
- Merchant-based capitalists (tư bản thương nghiệp)
- Landlords (địa chủ)
- Lending capitalists (tư bản cho vay)
- Fake capitalists (tư bản giả) (aka financial capitalists, tư bản tài chính)

## Merchant-based capitalists
Born at the same time with capitalism:
- Division of labor + Specialization => Needs a subject to distribute [[comod]]s
- Third party between producers and consumers
- Expansion of market scale (sự mở rộng quy mô thị trường) => producers need to survey their consumption market.

**Definition:**
- The kind of capitalist that engaged (gắn kết) with producers.
- Being the representatives of the producers in [[comod]] consumption.
- And have a share of the [[profit]] with the producers.

Before capitalism is a thing, merchants and producers did not like each other, with merchants being the customers of producers, selling the products at a high price (mua rẻ bán đắt, mua đứt bán đoạn) => they were hated by society.
=> Merchants and MBCs have an important difference in *chất*

**Merchant-based profit** is a part of the [[surplus]] that laborers created, being shared with the MBCs for their roles in [[comod]] consumption.
=> Total production cost: $K=K_{prod}+K_{merch}=(C_{prod}+C_{merch})+(V_{prod}+V_{merch})$
=> Total [[surplus]]: $M=M_{prod}+M_{merch}$

In reality, this profit is called by many names like commission (hoa hồng), percentage? (tỷ lệ phần trăm), etc., and it is determined by the average profit rate $\bar{P'}$.

## Lending capitalists
There are two interesting types of [[ssh/ktct/new/surplus/capital|capital]]:
- Temporarily-free capital (tư bản tạm thời nhàn rỗi): Capital that is temporarily having no purposes.
- Profit-potential capital (tư bản sản xuất có khả năng sinh lời): Capital that has high potential, but lack investment
Owners of TFC created a service where they can lend their TFC to invest in PPC.

**Lending capital**:
- TFC
- Owner transferred the **right to use** to another party.
- The objective of the (previous) owner is to have **instant profit** (lợi tức).

=> The two rights (*to own* and *to use*) are separated.

**Lending instant profit** (LIP, denoted $Z_{cv}$)
- is a part of laborers' [[surplus]] that was cut from the total surplus by the capitalist in order to exchange for **the right to use lent capital**
- can be calculated via the interest rate $Z_{cv}'$ and the total lent capital: $Z_{cv}=Z'_{cv}\cdot K_{cv}$
- the interest rate is the result of negotiation between two sides, heavily dependent on the average profit rate $\bar{P'}$

## Fake capitalists
Fake capital is stocks, coins and these kinds of meme stuff. They does not involve [[labor]], so their [[price]] is not determined via [[value]] but rather economic gains (lợi ích kinh tế).
The circulation of fake capital is separated from real capital (e.g. in stock markets), and is heavily affected by [[s-d]] and stock market transactions.
The value of fake capital depends on many factors, like "cổ tức của trái phiếu", "quyền kiểm soát của nhà phát hành", "kỳ vọng chênh lệch giá mua bán".

## Agriculture-based capitalists
### Agriculture business in capitalism
- 3 classes: farmers, landowners/landlords, capitalists
- Landlords: have monopoly in land ownership + agriculture production
	- One can't do agriculture in middle east for example
- The OCC: $\frac{C}{V}$ is lower than in industries.
=> conclusions
- Agriculture have higher profit rate than other sectors: $P_{agri}\geq \bar{P}$, $P_{agri}$ is not decreased by outside competition.
- The profit can't be all taken from the capitalist, some of that must be shared with the landowners: **ground rent** (địa tô)

**Ground rent**:
- A part of [[surplus]] generated via [[labor]], "dôi ra ngoài" $\bar{P}$
- Was stolen by the capitalist, then was give back to the landlords
- Calculated as $GR=P_{agri}-\bar{P}$

**Types of GR**:
- Absolute: not depend on the profit, the exact amount must be paid to the landowners (since $P_{\text{agri norm}}>\bar{P}$).
- Difference I: additional profit stems from naturally good land (since $P_{\text{agri super}} > P_{\text{agri norm}}>\bar{P}$), which must be paid to the landowners (super: siêu ngạch).
- Difference II: additional profit stems from soil improvements made by the capitalists, which makes the profit increase somewhat similarly to Difference I => the capitalist owns Difference II.
=> When the contract is renewed, the capitalist would want to keep the same GR, but the greedy landowners want to increase the GR, on the basis of the improved soil => If mutual agreement can't be met, the capitalists destroy the soil, i.e. "khai thác đất cùng kiệt" before the contract ends.
