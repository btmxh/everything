Production cost of capitalism (chi phí sản xuất tư bản chủ nghĩa), $K=C+V$.
$K$ does not show the full picture of what's happening under the hood, making $C$ and $V$ the same thing despite $V$ is the only thing giving $M$.
Hence, it leads to the misconception that every bit of $K$ generate $M$, making [[labor]] and $V$ insignificant. => This covered up the exploitative nature of capitalism.
