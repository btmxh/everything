**Organic composition of capital** (OCC, cấu tạo hữu cơ của tư bản)
- Technical CoC: The ratio $\frac{\#\text{Means of production}}{\#\text{Labor}}$
- Value CoC: The ratio $\frac{C}{V}$
- OCC: the value CoC, but considered in a tight relationship with technical CoC (basically a combination of the two CoC, but heavily based on VCoC)

In exercises, one can consider OCC and VCoC the same thing.

**Law:** As technology develops, production become more automatic => $C$ inc, $V$ dec => $\frac{C}{V}$ inc

This effectively made more and more laborers obsolete => unemployment. Hence, unemployment is an unavoidable consequence of capitalism.
