vi: giá trị kinh tế

[[value]] is what decides the [[exchange value]] of a [[comod]].

## pre-LTV
One would naively consider [[use value]] and [[value]] to be the same. Sure this may explain why "gà công nghiệp" is cheaper than "gà ta", but it failed to explain why (breathing) air (which is crucial for survival) have basically zero [[exchange value]].

## LTV
Marx's **Labor theory of value** (LTV) argues that the [economic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics) "Value (economics)") of a [[comod]] is determined by the total amount of "[socially necessary labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_necessary_labour_time "Socially necessary labour time")" (hao phí lao động xã hội) required to produce it. (or *...SNL of the producer crystallized in the product*)
=> answers two important questions:
- why value is exchangable? (1 xe máy = 10 tấn thóc): because it has the same "unit" (labor time)
- why every [[comod]] has [[value]]?: because  [[comod]]'s most important property is being "a result of human labor"

### Features
- only meaningful if [[trade]] is present
- only shown if circulated (lưu thông), exchanged (trao đổi), or sale (mua bán)
- the **price** is this **value** represented as **money**

## theories
### [[use value]] decides [[value]]
e.g. gà ta > gà công nghiệp, because the former is more yummy
=> not true, because:
- e.g. air: very crucial but zero price
> *lesson: many great people still have shit pay*
- [[use value]] is not interchangable between different kinds of [[goods]]

### [[cost of labor]]
e.g. air: abundant -> [[cost of labor]] = 0 => [[value]] = 0
e.g. gà ta: harder to raise -> [[value]] higher
=> "tiền nào của nấy": false

## props
- not eternal, because it depends on [[goods]] trade
	- without trade, [[value]] is meaningless, one can't eat gold to survive
	- in utopian communism, [[value]] is approx 0 for all [[goods]] => meaningless
		- e.g. in families, parents dont care about the [[value]] lost to their children because they don't consider their children as [[goods]]
- represented in trading, selling, buying, circulation

=> [[value]] is the value of [[goods]] measured by [[ssh/ktct/new/commodity/money]]
**price**: the [[value]] measured in monetary units

## measure: via amt of [[value]]
- the amt of [[cost of labor]] on manifacturing [[goods]]
- measured in the **typical** *social manifacturing time* to manifacture [[goods]]
	- **typical**: measured in avg conditions: laborer with mid skill, mid technology, mid devices, mid outside conditions
	- e.g. old stuff: low skill, low tech, ... -> may still have high value because of
		- the copious amt of time (trầm tích thời gian)
		- historical significance (số phận lịch sử)
- => **problem:** hard to measure this, so one typically measure the [[value]] of [[goods]] produced by the biggest manifacturer on the [[market]]
