- **def**: all "công dụng" (usage?) of the [[comod]] to satisfy some specific human needs (material needs + spiritual needs)
> as society progresses, the value of spiritual needs increases, being the deciding factor in competition
	- house: orig as a place for shelter -> show off
	- clothes: orig to hide pp and defend from weather -> show off
	- brands: same products without the brands -> ded
	- => one must be creative, improve upon the original to create brand new material needs

## props
- $\infty$ as long as humans are alive
- only present in the field of consumption (usage)
	- this is trivial, because one can't realize the use value of something without using it
	- e.g. a car may look good (so it does have satisfies some spiritual needs) but if one does not drive it, it's useless as a vehicle/its vehicle usage value is zero or sth
- [[use value]] has in it an [[exchange value]]

=> [[use value]] is the content value that lies inside the [[goods]] itself
