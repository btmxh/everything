vi: tự cung tự cấp (it kinda looks like the word autism lmfao)

a [[comod]] originally was intended to be *used*
> use: satisfy some human requirement, want or need, or which serves a useful purpose

in an autarkic society, [[comod]] were primarily intended to be used, due to many reasons:
- lack of [[comod]] => people would consume them as fast as possible
	- => one may say that duybuan cultural capitalism is actually autarky
- no established economy/lack of [[comod]] variants/etc.

as society progresses, these reasons became less and less of an issue =>[[comod prod]]
