## origin
### conds
### Division of labor (DOL) reached a specific level
- **DOL** (vi: phân công lao động xã hội)
	- the *division* of *working forces* into different economic sectors.
	- towards **specialization**
	- obey **objective laws**
- Advanced DOL => advanced specialization => people are more efficient with their work => 2 main results:
	- [[labor productivity]] increases => more excess [[comod]] => manufacturers can use them all => [[trade]]
	- each manufacturer can only produce some limited types of [[comod]], but their use case need a diverse amount of [[comod]] => [[trade]]
### Relative independence between manufacturers (RIBM)
- **RIBM** (vi: sự tách biệt tương đối giữa các nhà sản xuất): the independence in ... of manufacturers:
	- Ownership (sở hữu)
	- Autonomy (tự chủ)
	- Self-responsibility (tự chịu trách nhiệm)
- RIBM makes the economy more fair (one person's mistake had minimal effect on the others') => became the motivation of economic growth

## Commodity production (CP)
**def: CP** (sản xuất hàng hóa):
- an economic production system (mô hình sản xuất kinh tế)
- [[comod]] is produced to be [[trade]]d in the [[market]]

- CP's main selling point is the viability of large-scale production, since in [[autarky]] economies, the products from said productions could not be all used by itself.
- CP had removed the production limit for all productions, motivating people to improve their skills, pipelines, etc. effectively removing conservative mindset from production.

## Features
- [[comod]]'s primary value is its [[value]], since they are all produced to be traded.
- [[comod prod]] both has individual-istic (tính tư nhân) and society-istic (tính xh)
	- individual-istic: because of the RIBM, the leaders of productions would dominate the market, deciding what their products would behave like
	- society-istic
		- because of products being served to society, it must satisfy the need of said society
		- producing [[comod]]s in CP usually is a collaboration between many producers.
	- => this contradiction serves as the motivation of development in [[comod]] production
	- => the individual-istic serves as the primary reason for economic crises.
- the main aim of productions in CP is the products' [[value]]

## advantages
- Further accelerate the DOL => more specialization, more efficiency, more productivity => **productive forces development**
- CP is based on **competition** => give motivations to producers => **human creativity is extensively used** to increase efficiency, productivity, etc.
- Motivate global cooperating => phát huy lợi thế mỗi quốc gia, giao lưu và phát triển văn hóa
