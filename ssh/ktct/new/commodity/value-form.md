vi: lượng giá trị (hàng hóa)
- According to LTV, [[value]] is the total SNL of the producer crystallized in the product.
> The "social" prefix in the term SNL means that we are only considering abstract [[ssh/ktct/surplus/labor]]
- To measure [[value]], one use [[value-form]], defined as the total socially necessary labor **time** of the producer crystallized in the product.
> The SNLT does not equal to the *specifically necessary labor time* (SpNLT, thời gian hao phí lao động cá biệt) of bla bla, which means that in order to increase profits, one can decrease the SpNLT.

The value of a [[comod]] is the sum of values in past labor (e.g. in the materials) + new labor (e.g. in the labor to turn raw materials into comod)

## Dependent factors
### Productivity
**def**: *phạm trù* repr the efficiency of [[comod]] production
measured in: $\frac{\text{Num of comods}}{Time}$ or production time for an unit of [[comod]] => $\propto \frac{1}{\text{Value of an unit of comod}}$
Since the total labor time does not change, **productivity does not affect the net value of [[comod]]s**, and hence, the **value of each unit of [[comod]]s** decreases.
> **proof**
> since intensity $I$ const (see next part), $V \propto T$, and since $T$ const, $V$ const => net value const
> let $p=\frac{N}{T}$ (with $N$ being the number of [[comod]], $T$ being the time required to produce $N$ [[comod]]s)
> value of an unit of [[comod]], $v=\frac{V}{N} \propto \frac{T}{N}=\frac{1}{p}$ => $p \propto \frac{1}{v}$

this is not a bad thing, since increasing productivity will decrease the **specific value** of each unit of [[comod]], and as one can see from the first part of this page, this increase profits.

### Intensity
vi: cường độ (lao động)
**def**: *phạm trù* repr the *density* of [[ssh/ktct/surplus/labor]] in a period of time.
=> $I=\frac{\text{Labor}}{\text{Labor Time}}=\frac{\text{Value}}{\text{Labor Time}}=\frac{V}{T}$

- $\propto \text{Net value of comods}$
- => Does not change $\text{Value of an unit of comod}$
> **proof**
> Since labor time $T$ const, $I \propto V$: net value of comods
> $I \propto N$ (which also means that $I \propto p$ and $p$ is not const) => $v=\frac{V}{N}$ const
> (the second claim is kinda stupid btw)


## Complexity
vi: mức độ phức tạp (của lao động)
- Simple [[ssh/ktct/surplus/labor]] (lao động giản đơn): [[ssh/ktct/surplus/labor]] that one laborer can give even without proper training
- Complex [[ssh/ktct/surplus/labor]] (lao động phức tạp): [[ssh/ktct/surplus/labor]] that one laborer can give only with proper training

=> In the same period of time, complex labor gives much more [[value]] than simple labor.
