## computer
- an electronic device that do:
	- recv input data
	- [[it/intro/process]] [[info]] accordingly to [[program]] stored in [[memory]]
	- send output data
- structure ![[Pasted image 20230410151223.png]]
- (model by von neumann, 1954)

- uses:
	- [[it/intro/process]] data
		- most important use
		- data may have multiple types and have different instructions
	- store data
			- [[data]] can be immediately [[it/intro/process]]ed or stored in memory
			- when info is needed, it will be pulled out from memory to be processed
		- two types of memory
			- ram: data lost if power is lost
			- hdd, ssd: data doesn't need power to sustain
	- transfer data
		- source: i/o devices
		- if distance is far => data communication
	- 

- deeper structure

	> note: most input/output devices are both input devices and output devices at the same time
	> 	e.g. the projector: output display + input the progress status, etc.

## basic structure
- [[cpu]]
- main memory: store [[data]] and [[program]]
- i/o system: transfer [[info]] between the [[computer]] and the outside world
- system interconnection (liên kết hệ thống): connect, transfer data between computer components like cpu, main memory, etc.

## operations
- basic op: execute [[program]]:
	- cpu recv instruction
	- cpu exec instruction
