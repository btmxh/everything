list of commands in [[memory]] instructs the [[computer]] to do stuff
[[computer]] always works according to [[program]]

**software**: same as [[program]] but have wider meaning
"soft" because one can easily change it, unlike hardwares

## system programs
interchangable with OS - operating system
- control the actions of computers
- provide the env between user and programs
- optimize system resource usage
- => need high stability and safe
- e.g. os, bios, program to format disk (?), etc.

## application programs
apps
- to do one specific task
- must be installed after some OS (or one can provide the OS along with the program idk)
- u get these from package managers, app stores, etc.

## programming
to make the computer do stuff, one must instruct it to do something, via either using some applications or make your own ones via **programming**
**programming language**: is the language one'd need to know in order to **program**
one use **programming lang** to write the **source code**, which *may* be translated into **machine code** by some program (**compiler**) to be executed (or it's directly interpreted ig)

### machine code
depends on
- specific hardware version, generation, brand (i386, x64_86, etc.)
- may not be directly executed via the user (microcodes)
### asm
depends on
- somewhat platform specific like above, but one can read this easier due to its **textual format**
- computer can only execute the **binary format**, which must be compiled via an **assembler**
- attached with the computer architecture (one can directly access the registers)
- e.g. in 8086, ADD AX, BX => he skipped to the next slide :skull:
### high-level
bla bla bla stfu i knew all of this idc
