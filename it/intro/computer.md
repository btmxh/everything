digital thing do: input -> [[process]] according to a [[program]] -> output

## history
gen 1: 50-58
	vacuum tubes, alternating current
	poke holes to modify [[memory]] (poke at 1)
	=> huge size, manual, high energy consumption, slow (300-3000 op/s)
gen 2: 58-64
	transistors, direct current
	size: gen 1: cm -> gen 2: nm (nowadays) => "greatest invention in computing"
	material: silicon => abundant
gen 3: 65-74
	IC: integrated circuit
gen 4: 74-now
	large scale integration
	multi processors
gen 5: 90-now
	VLSI, ULSI (very/ultra large scale int.)
	AI (artificial intelligence): simulate human brain, behavior
	=> high af speed + parallel computing
