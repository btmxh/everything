- Let $H$ be the set of all humans on Earth.
- The **name** map is a map from $H$ to the set of strings $S$ such that for each $h \in H$, $f(h)$ is the human $h$'s name.
- Then a partial order relation $\leq'$ is called a **momx** relation if and only if there is only **maximal element** $h$ of $H$ with respect to $\leq'$, and $f(h)$ is the string "Nguyen Viet Tuan Kiet"
- The human $h$ is now called the **bird** of $(H, \leq')$
