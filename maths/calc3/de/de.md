differential equations are functional equations that involves the variable function's derivatives (or even integrals idk)

e.g. find $y$ s.t. $y'=F(x)$
- at first sight, you may say "taking the integral of both side...", but it's not that simple
- we need to prove that $y'$ and $F$ are both r-intbl
- $y'$ exists => $y$ cont => r-intbl
- if $F(x)$ is r-intbl => $y=\int_{x_{0}}^{x} F(x) \, dx +C$
- otherwise, todo

the solution of a [[de]] is a fn that satisfies its requirements, and solving a [[de]] is the act of finding **all** solutions for this [[de]]

the most simple form of [[de]], [[ode]] is de with only one variables, which will be the primary target of this calc3 chapter
