consider a random experiment with sample space $\Omega$. a **random variable** is a map from $\Omega$.
- e.g. the 6-dice experiment sample space is isomorphic to the set $\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}$, => one can take $X$ to be this isomorphism
	- the same experiment can also have $Y$ to be $X \operatorname{mod} 2$ as another random var

consider a random variable $X: \Omega\to \Omega'$
if $\Omega'$ is finite/countable, one call this a [[discrete]] dist.
if $\Omega'$ is uncountably infinite, this is now a [[cont]] dist.

in analyzing random variable, one often ignore $\Omega$ and consider the mapped sample space $\Omega'$ to be the de facto sample space.
