for [[field#^55c459|scalar fields]], the [[jacobian]] is a row vector => one can take its transpose to get the column (which is standard) vector => it's called the [[gradient]]
$$
	\boxed{\nabla f(x_{0})=f'(x_{0})^{T}}
$$
corollary: find [[directional]]
$\frac{\partial f}{\partial \hat{v}}=L_{x_{0}}(\hat{v})=f'(x_{0})\hat{v}=\text{(in the m=1 case) }\nabla f(x_{0})\cdot \hat{v}$
