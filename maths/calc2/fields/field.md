field is basically just a map (usually differentiable) from a vector set ($\mathbb{R}^{3}, \mathbb{R}^{4}$) to another scalar/vector set ($\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}^{3}, \mathbb{R}^{4}$)

**scalar fields** are fields that maps to a scalar set like $\mathbb{R}$, and **vector fields** are fields that maps to a vector set like $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ ^55c459
