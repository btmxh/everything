field is basically just a map (usually differentiable) from a vector set ($\mathbb{R}^{3}, \mathbb{R}^{4}$) to another scalar/vector set ($\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}^{3}, \mathbb{R}^{4}$)

## scalar field
fields that maps to a scalar set like $\mathbb{R}$

## vector field
fields that maps to a vector set like $\mathbb{R}^{3}$

### conservative vector field
these following statements are equivalent:
- $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative
- $\nabla \times \mathbf{F}=0$
- $\oint \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{s}=0$ along all closed path

then, there exists some [[field#scalar field|scalar field]] $\phi$ (called the [[scalar potential]] of $\mathbf{F}$) such that $\mathbf{F}=\nabla \phi$

### solenoidal vector field
basically there are no sources (div > 0) or sinks (div < 0) in the field, i.e. div = 0 everywhere, or $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{F}=0$)

**scalar fields** are fields that maps to a scalar set like $\mathbb{R}$, and **vector fields** are fields that maps to a vector set like $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ ^55c459
