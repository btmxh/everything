the improper integral $I(y)=\int _{a}^{b_{0}} f(x,y)dx$ (singularity only at $b_{0}$) can be thought as the limit of $I_{b}(y)=\int _{a}^b f(x)dx$ as $b\to b_{0}$

then we can define [[uniconv]] to this shit

## cont
since uniform cont can't be inferred from $[a,\infty]$, we can't just have $f_{n}$ cont => $f$ cont like [[paraint]]
we need one additional cond: [[uniconv]]
proof is at the [[uniconv#properties#cont]]

## int8
cond: $f$ cont/$[a,b)\times$(y-space) + [[uniconv]]
TODO: nxt's corollary

## diff.
cond: $f,f'_{y}$ cont/xy-space + $\int f'_{y}(x,y)dx$ [[uniconv]]  (+ ofc $\int f(x,y)dx$ cont)
