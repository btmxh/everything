a curve is a 1-[[manifold]] (every point has a neighborhood that's homeomorphic to a interval of $\mathbb{R}$)

a curve can be the concatenation of multiple curves

a simple curve can be given using two main methods

## parametric curve
curve given by a [[vec fn]] $\mathbf{r}(t)$
curves in the form of $y=f(x)$ can also be considered a parametric curve: $\mathbf{r}(t) = (t, f(t))$

## implicit curve
curve given by $n-1$ equations $F_1(\mathbf{r}) = F_2(\mathbf{r}) = ... = F_{n-1}(\mathbf{r}) = 0$, where $\mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a point on the curve (can be interpreted as the intersection of $n-1$ hyperplanes)
