a s-point of a [[manifold]] is a point s.t. all neighborhood of that s-point, the curve is not "smooth" (not differentiable at that pt)

for [[curve#parametric curve|p-curves]] and [[surface#parametric surfaces|p-surfaces]], a pt is singular iff it's differential at that pt is the zero fn

for implicit manifolds like [[curve#implicit curve|i-curves]], [[surface#implicit surfaces|i-surface]], the condition is iff $\nabla F_i = 0$ for all $i \in 1..<n$
