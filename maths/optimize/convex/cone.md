[[sublinear]] with weight condition $w\geq 0$

## Recession cone
**Theorem:** The set of all [[recession dir]] of a set $A$ is a cone.
**Proof**
- We need to prove that for $w_{1},w_{2}\geq 0$, if $d_{1},d_{2}$ are [[recession dir]]$s$, then the linear combination $w_{i}d_{i}$ is also a [[recession dir]].
- We know $x+td_{1}$ and $x+td_{2}$ are in $A$ for all $t$, and need to prove $x+t(w_{1}d_{1}+w_{2}d_{2})$ are in $A$ for all $x$
- This is true, since $x'=x+tw_{1}d_{1}$ is in $A$ and $x'+tw_{2}d_{2}$ is also in $A$, $\blacksquare$
