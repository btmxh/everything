## random trial, basic event
- **Random trial** (trial) is an action with random outcomes, i.e. one can not forecast the exact outcome. However, one could enumerate all possible outcomes of such trial.

>e.g. Roll a dice: an action
>Take interest in the number of dots on the upper side
>Outcomes: $w_{i}$: "there are $i$ dots on the upper side" for $i\in 1..6$
>=> This is a random trial
>$\Omega=\{ w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},w_{4},w_{5},w_{6} \}$ is the set of all possible outcomes.

The set of all possible outcomes is the **sample space**, denoted as $\Omega$. Every possible outcome, i.e. an element of $\Omega$ is called a **basic event** (sự kiện sơ cấp).
