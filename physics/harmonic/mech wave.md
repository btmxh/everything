the propagation of [[harmonic motion]] in a elastic env
basically, some particles is out of place => other pulls it back + it push others out => shit storm

- source: the first particle that's out of place
- wave "ray": the direction of propagation

## types
- longitudinal wave: motion in ray
	- e.g. pressure stuff, etc.
- transverse wave: motion perp ray
	- e.g. light, etc.

## measureable stuff
- period, frequency: $Tf=1$
- velocity $v$
	- long. => $v=\sqrt{ \frac{1}{\alpha \rho} }=\sqrt{ \frac{E}{\rho} }$, with $E$ being the young's modulus (suất y-âng), $\rho$ is the mass density of the propagating environment
	- trans. (literally me) => $v=\sqrt{ \frac{G}{\rho} }$, with $\rho$ is the same thing as above, $G$ is the shear's modulus (modun trượt)
- wavelength $\lambda=\frac{v}{f}$ (distance between 2 points with the same phase)

- wavefront (mặt sóng): locus of point with same phase![[Pasted image 20230423195335.png]]
- dest. wavefront (mặt đầu sóng): the end of the wave, aka boundary of wave - nowave regions
