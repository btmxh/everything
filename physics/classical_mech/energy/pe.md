potential energy: the part of [[energy]] that doesn't depend on an object's motion (idk if that's true tho)
since [[energy]] is relative, [[pe]] is also relative, i.e. one can add $C$ to the pe at all states and still ended up with some valid [[pe]]
[[pe]] relative to some state $S$ is the [[pe]] when you set $C$ s.t. the [[pe]] at $S$ is zero
