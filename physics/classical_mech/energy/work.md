- if force is const, then the [[work]] $W$ by the force $\mathbf{F}$ on an interval $\mathbf{s}$ is defined as
$$
W=\mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{s}=Fs\cos\alpha
$$
where $\alpha$ is the angle between the two vectors:
- if $\alpha< \frac{\pi}{2}, W>0$, then "lực sinh công phát động"
- if $\alpha > \frac{\pi}{2}, W < 0$, then "lực sinh công cản"
- otherwise, when $\alpha= \frac{\pi}{2}$, then $W=0$, there's no work, "lực ko sinh công"

- if force is not const, then assuming that work is additive, one can derive the formula of work by taking the sum of infinitesimal "sub-works"
- the work on a infinitesimal [[arclen]]: $dW=\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{s}$, then taking the integral of both sides:
$$
W=\int _{I} \mathbf{F}d\mathbf{s} 
$$

the unit of [[work]] is jules (J)
the rate of change for [[work]] is called [[power]]
