- energy repr the "mức độ vận động" of matter
- an object at a state has some specific energy => **energy is a function of state**
- an object interacting with the work may take in/transfer out its energy
- in mechanics, the transfer of energy is made possible by [[work]]
- [[work]] repr the process of energy transfer between 2 objects

## conservation of energy
let $E_{1}$ be the energy of a system $S$, after some process, its energy became $E_{2}$, then it can be proven that
$$
\Delta E=E_{2}-E_{1}=W\text{: amt of work that the system recv}
$$
=> the amount of change in energy of a system after some process is equal to the amount of [[work]] that the system recv from the outside by that process

if $W>0 \implies E$ inc
if $W<0 \implies E$ dec
for isolated systems, $E$ is const => energy is conserved
**the energy of an isolated system is conserved**

**meaning:**
- "vận động" of matter is conserved
- energy is finite: one object can't generate [[work]] forever without energy from outside
- u can't make perpetual motion (of first kind)

## [[work]] != [[energy]]
they have a rather interesting relation, but [[work]] **is not** [[energy]]
- work: fn of **process** != energy: fn of **state**
- energy: always exist != work: exist iff there is some change to the system
- (work can be thought of as the change of energy, but not energy itself)
