vi: **vận tốc vũ trụ cấp 1**
the vietnamese one only refers to the orbital speed of the Earth (so L bozo)

**problem**: let $m$ orbitting $M$ in a stable orbit of radius $r$. then what's the min speed of $m$?

orbit is stable iff grav acts as centripetal force: $\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r} \iff v=\sqrt{ \frac{GM}{r} }=\sqrt{ gr }$

when $r$ and $M$ are the radius and the mass of the Earth (neglecting the altitude of the object wrt to the earth's surface), the expr evaluates to about 7.9km/s
