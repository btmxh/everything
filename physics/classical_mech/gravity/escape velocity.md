vi: **vận tốc vũ trụ cấp 2**

this is the speed needed to escape the gravity of stuff
total work to move the object to infinity is the difference between [[pe]] of [[newton grav]]: $m(V(\infty)-V(\mathbf{r}))=\frac{GMm}{r}$ => one must supply this amount of energy via [[ke]]: $\frac{GMm}{r}=\frac{mv^{2}}{2} \implies v=\sqrt{ \frac{2GM}{r} }=\sqrt{ 2v_{o} }=\sqrt{ 2gr }$
