for every [[curve#parametric curve|p-curve]] $\mathbf{r}(t)$ (with no singular points), one can derive an natural parameterization of that curve $\mathbf{r}(s)$
=> one can use $s$: arc length parameter to determine t and therefore the state of the object at that moment in time => $s$ can be considered a function of time: $s(t)$
