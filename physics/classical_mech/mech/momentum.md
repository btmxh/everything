**def**: let $m$ be the mass of an object travelling with velocity $\mathbf{v}$, then $\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}$ is the [[momentum]] of the object

## theorems
### first theorem
in an [[inertial frame of ref]], $\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}=m\mathbf{v}'=(m\mathbf{v})'=\mathbf{p'}$ (if the mass is not changing)
=> **the derv. of momentum of a [[point mass]] wrt time is the net force exerted on that [[point mass]]**

### second theorem
since $\mathbf{F}dt=d\mathbf{p}$, by integrating both side, one gets $\Delta \mathbf{p}= \mathbf{p_{2}}-\mathbf{p_{1}}=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf{F}dt$
=> **the change in momentum of a [[point mass]] in some interval of time is the [[impulse]] of the net force exerted on that [[point mass]] in that period of time**

if $\mathbf{F}$ const wrt $t$, then $\Delta \mathbf{p}=\mathbf{F}\Delta t \iff \frac{\Delta \mathbf{p}}{\Delta t}=\mathbf{F}$ (congratulations you have gone full circle)
=> **the rate of change in momentum of a [[point mass]] wrt time is the force exerted on that [[point mass]]**

## meaning
- the combination of both [[mass]] $m$ and [[velocity]] $\mathbf{v}$
	- its change in a unit of time is equal to the outside force exerted on the object
	- => **đặc trưng cho chuyển động về mặt động lực học**
- **repr the ability to transfer motion** (đặc trưng cho khả năng truyền chuyển động)

## conservation of [[momentum]]
### for an isolated system
consider an isolated system with the i-th object having mass $m_{i}$, momentum $\mathbf{p_{i}}$ affected by force $\mathbf{F_{i}}$
then the sum of all momentum (this uses einstein summation) $\frac{d\mathbf{p_{i}}}{dt}=\mathbf{F_{i}}$ const => $\mathbf{p_{i}}$ const
=> the sum of **momentum** of an isolated system is conserved

### conservation in an axis
for a non-isolated system, if the outside force is 0 wrt to an axis $\vec{a}$, then one can use the same logic and therefore:
=> the **projection** of the sum of **momentum** of the system is conserved
