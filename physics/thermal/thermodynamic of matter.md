## structure of matter
- matter are made of atoms, molecules
- in 1mol of gas, there are $N_{A}$ molecules (omg what a genius idea this totally does not come from the definition of a mole)
- molecules are not next to each other (highly doubt this for general matter: solid, liquid tho), distance >> size
- a molecule is about $10^{-10}$m in size, and interact:
	- dist. $r < 3\cdot 10^{-10}$ => push
	- dist. $3\cdot 10^{-10}<r<15\cdot 10^{-10}$ => pull
	- otherwise => neglectable
- the molecule total volume = 1/1000 gas volume

## the theory
- "chất cấu tạo gián đoạn, gồm số lớn các phân tử"
- the molecules are all in motion nonstop
- ([[ideal gas]] only) the molecules' velocity combined repr the [[temperature]]
- ([[ideal gas]] only) size of molecules' << distance => one can consider them to be [[point mass]]
- ([[ideal gas]] only) molecules don't interact
