the temperature repr the sum of [[ke]] (subtracting rotation energy) of all atoms
=> it's the sum of [[ke]] (with no subtraction) for [[ideal gas]]

unit: kelvin, celsius ($0C=273.16K$)

the relationship between [[temperature]] and [[velocity]] is provided using the boltzmann const $k$

## shc
specific heat capacity $c'$ (nhiệt dung riêng) is the amount of heat one would need to increase an unit of mass an unit of temperature (unit: $[W]M^{-1}T^{-1}=L^{2}t^{2}T^{-1}$, t is time)

well ofc we have $Q=mc'\Delta T$
the molecular heat capacity $C$ (nhiệt dung phân tử) is that but instead of an unit of mass yeah it's an unit of *concentration* (mol)
well then $Q=nC\Delta t=\frac{m}{\mu}c_{m}\Delta T$
