heat and [[work]] is basically the same shit in the microscopic level (if heat exists at all), but in the macroscopic level, work makes stuff moves **in order**, while heat makes stuff more chaotic, increasing the system's internal [[energy]]

like [[work]], heat is not energy, and is a function of process

since in the microscopic level they're the same, they have a relationship, and one can convert between them (e.g. $4.18J \iff 1 \text{calo}$)

=> [[work]] and [[heat]] are used to measure the **transfer** of [[energy]], not some manifestation of [[energy]], they don't exist in some state of a system unlike [[energy]] they are a fn of process
