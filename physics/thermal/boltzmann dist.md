assuming we have some [[gas]], in which each particles can have one of the state $s(i)\in S$, for some index $i\in I$ (like in [[uniconv]], $I$ can be $\mathbb{R}$)
- e.g. elevation can be a state: $I=[0, h_{max}]$, $s(i)$ is the particle has elevation $i$
if at state $s(i)$, the particle has energy $\varepsilon(i)$, then one can prove that (using "number of ways" bullshitery) the probability (which $\propto$ [[pressure]]) of a particle having that state is $\propto$ $e^{ -\varepsilon(i)/kT }$, i.e. the less energy it have the more likelihood

**proof**
- in gravity case, one can assume that $dp=-\mu gdh$, and taking the integral yields $p \propto e^{ -\mu gh/kT }=e^{ -PE/kT }$
- see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDKjLzbXYQI for the general case
