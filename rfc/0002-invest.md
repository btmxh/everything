## Summary
This is an RFC to invest (pay money) in order to get access to certain services, platforms, softwares, etc. 

## Motivation
The piracy lifestyle of the nation has been efficient and giving exposure to various piracy technologies and making the nation independent of any companies or corporations, however, there are evidences of such lifestyle reducing national efficiency and social exposure.

This RFC aims to allow paying money for such services, giving the nation more opportunities on the Internet, especially on joining Internet projects. 

## Execution
### Money source
The nation hasn't been able to produce any money in the post-modern era, and the only promising source that the nation can get a hold of is the university intuition. Another possible source, although heavily criticized by the FFP, is family money.

On Dec 18th, 2022, Koikake was purchased, marking the first violation of the *no-purchase-policy* of the ROD, which has made further invest proposals that relies on family money basically impossible to get through. This means that the only possible way this RFC can be executed is via the nation getting some intuition. 

### Scope
The scope (amount of investment) should be small and manageable.

## Alternatives
The alternative approach to this is keep staying the way things are: the existing *no-purchase-policy* of the nation.
