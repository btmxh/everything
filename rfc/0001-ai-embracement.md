## Summary
This is an RFC to further embrace the advancements of [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) in certain aspects of the nation.

## Motivation
In the Modern era, AI has been advancing quite steadily and achieving various milestones. Autist Duybua also has utilized some sort of AI systems in their life, such as OCR in the "twitch chat v-tuber" project that unfortunately had been scraped (post-Ayumu era).

AI has somewhat of a low reputation in the ROD, since it's the "hyped and overrated technology". As a result, the nation purposefully avoided the DSAI program in University, and attended the Global ICT program (and then transferred to the Talented program).

In the post-modern era, AI has been advancing at such an alarming rate, with the introduction of GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to the general public. These tools, despite their potential, were not properly utilized in the ROD due to the strict financial policies of the nation, not allowing investments on these kinds of tools, as well as the piracy and anti-corporate mindset of the nation.

However, all of this must stop before it was too late. If the nation keeps on being conservative, it will be phased out due to AI and have a vulnurable future. And if AI was utilized, it may brought upon some fresh development within our programming sector.

## Execution

### AI tools utilization
This has some relations with the [[0002-invest]] proposal. 

### AI researching
The process of AI researching has not been executed much due to the lack of training data, applications, computing power and researching direction, etc.

### Cautious of hype trains
The AI hype train is somewhat similar to previous hype trains such as NFTs, cryptocurrency, etc., which is basically a scam to take people's money. It's integral to be cautious of these potential hype trains that may be a problem of the nation in the future.

## Alternatives
There is no sane alternative to this rfc since the embracement of AI technologies is inevitable if one's technological department wants to evolve during this era.
